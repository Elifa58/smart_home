I designed this board in 2023 for my friend's garduate project. 
In this project, NodeMCU turns relays on or off by triggering transistors according to the commands it receives over Wi-Fi. High-power devices in the house (lights, fans, etc.) can be controlled by turning on the relays. An LED in each relay circuit indicates whether the relay is active or not. This is a visual feedback that the system is working. The voltage regulator is used to provide the correct voltage to all circuit elements. In this project, ESP8266 is used to remotely control smart home devices over Wi-Fi. The devices connect to the internet, manage the relays, and turn on and off the electrical appliances in the house.
